This page presents a holistic view of your collection's URLs. Here's what to expect and how to navigate:

* **Accessing URL Details:** To visit the URL detail page for a specific collection, click on the 'View URLs' icon located on the bottom tool panel of the collection component on the main collections page.

* **Functionality:** Once there, you'll see the collection component at the top, followed by all associated URLs listed as individual URL components. You have the flexibility to edit these URLs, remove them from the collection, or perform other typical URL management tasks.
