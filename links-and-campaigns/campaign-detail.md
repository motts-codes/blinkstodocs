## **Campaign Detail Pages: A Closer Look**

Within our platform, each campaign is endowed with a comprehensive suite of details and analytics. There are two distinct sections to explore for each campaign:

## <mark style="color:purple;">**URL Detail Page:**</mark>&#x20;

This page presents a holistic view of your campaign's URLs. Here's what to expect and how to navigate:

* **Accessing URL Details:** To visit the URL detail page for a specific campaign, click on the 'View URLs' icon located on the bottom tool panel of the campaign component on the main campaigns page.

* **Functionality:** Once there, you'll see the campaign component at the top, followed by all associated URLs listed as individual URL components. You have the flexibility to edit these URLs, remove them from the campaign, or perform other typical URL management tasks.

**Managing URLs Within a Campaign:** If you need to disassociate URLs from the current campaign:

* **Select and Modify:** Similar to the bulk edit function, select the desired URLs and click on the 'Campaign' button on the bottom tool panel. Choose a different campaign name or select 'Default' to dissociate the URLs from the current campaign.
