# üéûÔ∏è Data Grid Copy/Paste

## <mark style="color:orange;">Shorten urls with DataGrid copy/paste</mark>

The 'Bulk Convert' page defaults to the tabular data or data grid option. Shortening URLs with the data grid is a breeze. Copy a list of URLs from a spreadsheet or directly from browser tabs into the URL fields. The data grid allows you to convert a maximum of 25 URLs. Customize alias and title if needed. Click 'Convert,' and you're good to go.

If there are no errors, the bulk conversion is completed and directed to dashboard page, where the urls components are available for further edits or sharing.

### <mark style="color:purple;">Common errors</mark>

&#x20;Common errors during datagrid bulk conversion include:

1. **Incorrect URLs:** Ensure all URLs are valid and include 'http://' or 'https://.'
2. **Invalid Alias:** Check that aliases consist of valid characters (0-9, a-z, A-Z, -, \_), have a length between 7 and 20 characters, and contain no spaces.
3. **Alias Already Exists:** Each alias must be unique within a specific domain.

When errors occur, the rows without errors will be successfully shortened, while the ones with errors will be displayed in the data grid, indicating the specific error type.&#x20;

Here is an example the errors during conversion:

Identify and address errors efficiently by checking the error type mentioned in the last column of the data grid. Correct any issues and then proceed with the conversion process
