# 🎞️ Data Grid Copy/Paste

## <mark style="color:purple;">Shorten urls with DataGrid copy/paste</mark>

The Bulk convert page shows the tabular data or data/grid option by default. Shortening urls with datagrid is quite easy. Copy a list of urls from a spreadhsheet or copy the links from the browser tabs to the url fields. You can convert a maximum of 25 ulrs with data grid.  Fill in alias and title if custom values are required. Click on Convert and you are done.

If there are no errors, the bulk conversion is completed and directed to dashboard page, where the urls components are available for further edits or sharing.
