When you input a term, the search engine looks for a full or partial match across several fields associated with your shortened URLs.

#### Search Criteria:

You can refine your search using various parameters:

1. **Shortened Link**: Search directly for the shortened alias (e.g., "wikipedia"), with or without the full domain (e.g., "[https://blinks.to/wikipedia](https://blinks.to/wikipedia)" or "blinks.to/wikipedia").

2. **Title**: Input either the complete title or a significant portion of it.
3. **Original Link**: Use the full or partial original URL that you shortened.

4. **Campaign Name**: Search for URLs associated with a specific campaign by entering the campaign's name.



## <mark style="color:purple;">Managing Search Results:</mark>

To assist with navigating through numerous results:

* **Pagination**: If your search yields more than 15 matches, pagination will be available to view additional results in a structured manner.
* **Sorting and Filtering**: Organize your search outcomes by the number of clicks or by date. You can also filter results based on campaign association, favorites, and other categories, similar to the options on the 'Links' page.
