### <mark style="color:orange;">Sidebar Accessibility:</mark>

For your convenience, the sidebar is designed to be collapsible, allowing you to maximize your workspace as needed.

**To Toggle Sidebar:**&#x20;

* Look for the toggle icon (represented by a blue vertical small line) situated at the right of the sidebar.
* When you **hover over this line**, it changes to an **arrow icon**â€”pointing rightwards to indicate expansion, or leftwards to signal retraction.
* Simply **click** on this icon to swiftly **expand or collapse** the sidebar.

This hover-to-reveal functionality allows for a clean interface while providing easy access to expand the sidebar when you need it.
