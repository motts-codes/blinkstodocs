**Important Reminder Regarding UTM Parameters:**
{% endhint %}

**Important Reminder Regarding UTM Parameters:**

When working with original URLs that already contain UTM parameters, our system takes special care to handle them appropriately. Please be aware of the following:

* **Preservation of Existing Parameters**: If your original long URL is already equipped with UTM parameters, rest assured, they will be preserved intact.
* **Preference for New Parameters**: In the event that you decide to introduce new UTM parameters via our platform, the pre-existing parameters in the original URL will be gracefully set aside. Instead, the newly provided parameters will take precedence and be utilized going forward.

By adhering to this approach, we ensure that you have the flexibility to update your tracking parameters as needed, while also maintaining the integrity of any existing parameters that were already in place.



<mark style="color:purple;">**Confirm Save Changes**</mark>

Once you have made all necessary modifications to your shortened URL, including customizing the UTM parameters for precise tracking, it is crucial to solidify these changes.

* **Save Your Changes**: Navigate to the 'Save Changes' button and give it a click. This action will update the URL with all the adjustments you've implemented.

By following this final step, you ensure that all your customizations and updates are applied and saved correctly, keeping your URL performance optimized and trackable.
