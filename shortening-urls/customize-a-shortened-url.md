**Important Reminder Regarding UTM Parameters:**

When working with original URLs that already contain UTM parameters, our system takes special care to handle them appropriately. Please be aware of the following:

* **Preservation of Existing Parameters**: If your original long URL is already equipped with UTM parameters, rest assured, they will be preserved intact.
* **Preference for New Parameters**: In the event that you decide to introduce new UTM parameters via our platform, the pre-existing parameters in the original URL will be gracefully set aside. Instead, the newly provided parameters will take precedence and be utilized going forward.

By adhering to this approach, we ensure that you have the flexibility to update your tracking parameters as needed, while also maintaining the integrity of any existing parameters that were already in place.
