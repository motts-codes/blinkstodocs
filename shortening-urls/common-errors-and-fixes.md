Errors associated with the long URL may occur due to various reasons:

* **Missing Protocol**: Ensure the URL begins with â€˜http://â€™ or â€˜https://â€™.
* **Prohibited Content**: The link must not include blacklisted domain keywords associated with explicit content, gambling, or substances (e.g., sex, gambling, porn, xxx, drugs, alcohol, cannabis).
* **Invalid Domain Ending**: The domain must conclude with a valid ending, such as '.com' or '.net'.
* **Invalid Characters**: Ensure the URL does not contain any invalid or unsupported characters.

**Alias Errors:** The custom alias field also has specific requirements:

* **No Spaces Allowed**: Ensure there are no spaces within the alias.
* **Character Restrictions**: Use only alphanumeric characters (0-9, a-z, A-Z), hyphens (-), or underscores (\_).
* **Character Limit**: The alias must be between 7 and 20 characters in length.
* **Unique Alias**: The alias must not be already in use.

**UTM Builder Notes:** While UTM parameters are optional, if you choose to provide one of the main parameters (utm\_campaign, utm\_source, or utm\_medium), all other main parameters are required for a comprehensive tracking setup. The â€˜utm\_termâ€™ and â€˜utm\_contentâ€™ parameters remain optional.
