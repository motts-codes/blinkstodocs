# üçÆ What are custom domains?

Custom domains in URL shortening offer a unique and powerful way to reinforce your brand identity while sharing links. Rather than using a generic URL shortener, custom domains allow users to create shortened links that reflect their brand or personal identity.

1. **Branding:** With a custom domain, your shortened links carry your brand name, making them more recognizable and trustworthy to your audience.
2. **Credibility:** Custom domains enhance the credibility of your links. Users are more likely to click on links that appear to come directly from your brand rather than a third-party URL shortening service.
3. **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent online presence by aligning your shortened links with your existing website domain. This coherence reinforces brand recall and professionalism.
4. **Trust:** Custom domains contribute to building trust with your audience. People are generally more cautious about clicking on links, and seeing a familiar domain helps alleviate concerns.
5. **SEO Benefits:** Using your custom domain can potentially provide SEO advantages. While link shorteners often use redirects, having links with your domain could positively impact your website's link profile.
